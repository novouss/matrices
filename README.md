# Matrix (mathematics)
In mathematics, a matrix (plural matrices) is a collection of integers, symbols, or expressions, arranged in rows and columns. Take the matrix below as an example, the dimensions of the matrix is 2 x 5 (read as "two by five") because it features two rows and five columns:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>-1</th>
    <th>2</th>
    <th>3</th>
    <th>4</th>
    <th>5</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>11</th>
    <th>9</th>
    <th>10</th>
    <th>8</th>
    <th>5</th>
  </tr>
</table>

# Matrix Basic Operations
The Matrix Calculator (as of now) features the ability to perform basic operations such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication, on two matrices dependent on the user's given input. Each column should be separated by a space, and each row is separated by pressing enter on your keyboard. Each operation has rules to abide by for it to perform a proper operation.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Addition and Subtraction</th>
    <th>Multiplication</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Matrices must have the exact same dimensions</th>
    <th>Matrices must have the same number of rows as there are columns in the other Matrix</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>The resulting matrix will have the same dimensions as the matrix that produced it</th>
    <th>The resulting matrix will have the same number of rows in the first matrix and the same number of columns on the second matrix</th>
  </tr>
</table>

# Matrix Division
In Matrices, there's no such thing as Division. You can only add, subtract, and multiply, but never divide. Although there is a concept called "inversion" that can provide a similar output. It involves a similar process to getting the "reciprocal" of a number. The Matrix Calculator features Determinants of a Matrix, Transposing, Determinants of Minors, Adjoint, and Inverse of Matrix, that collectively help in Dividing Matrices. Dividing matrices involves finding the Inverse of a Matrix, then multiplying it with the another matrix.
